    \multicolumn{4}{|A|}{This page is a model for the English thesis abstract. Its length should not exceed one page, and therefore, it may be written with single spacing. The font is Arial, font size 12, and the text typically has 3 to 5 paragraphs, each preceded by an empty line.} \\
    \multicolumn{4}{|A|}{The page begins with identification data in the correct fields, as presented in this template: author’s name, official name of Degree, month and year of approval, supervisors’ names with the official job titles (supervising teacher, the company name or the company’s representative, if the study was commissioned), number of pages from the title page to the end of the list of references / list of figures or tables, and the number of appendices. The first word in the title has capital initial. Otherwise, the title has lower-case initial letters, except for words that are capitalized for grammatical reasons.} \\
    \multicolumn{4}{|A|}{The abstract is a concise, independent account of the thesis content. It has about 200−250 words that summarize the main content. The text introduces the purpose, methods and key results and conclusions. Background information is not included, unless it is especially relevant for fully understanding the text without reading any other parts of the thesis. The text should not refer to any pages of the study, nor figures, tables or equations.} \\
    \multicolumn{4}{|A|}{The abstract is written in past tense, and passive voice (x was studied) and third person (this study examined) should be preferred over personal pronouns (I, we): First, the text introduces the aim of the study (The objective of the thesis was to...). Second, it explains the research method in general terms. (Qualitative methods were used to...). Finally, the text ends with the key results and conclusions (The study showed that...). This part can also discuss whether the thesis succeeded in achieving the goals set.} \\
    \multicolumn{4}{|A|}{The page ends with a field for 3 to 5 keywords accurately describing the thesis content.} \\
